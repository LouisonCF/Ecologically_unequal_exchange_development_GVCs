# Ecologically unequal exchange and uneven development patterns along global value chains -- Replication kit

This repository contains the code and material for __Althouse J., Cahen-Fourot L., Carballa-Smichowski B., Durand C., Knauss S. 2023, Ecologically unequal exchange and uneven development patterns along global value chains__, _World Development_, available open-access [__here__](url to be added when paper is online)

This code performs the statistical analysis for the article . It reproduces the clustering, exports the file with the PCA and clustering results and generates figures 2 (radar graph) and 3 (3D graph of cluster) in the paper.

---
Make sure you have the dataset _Data_EUE_GVC_index_variables.xlsx_ that you find in the same folder. This file contains the index variables upon which the clustering is performed.

Make sure your R version and the packages are up-to-date! This code was tested under R 4.2.2.

## Results

The code generates results of the PCA, the clustering, as well as figures of the principal components (not used in the article), the radar graph (figure 2) and the 3D graph (figure 3). 

In addition, the code generates three excel files: the file with the Keyser-Meyer-Ohlin and Bartlett tests results, the file with the PCA results and the file with the clustering results.
